This repository contains various programs used in the article. Specific programs are found in specific folders:


AnalyzeRhabdomereMovement: this folder contains a Matlab script for a cross-correlation image analysis of light-induced R1-R7 rhabdomere movements.


AntialiasingByRandomisation: this folder contains a Python script for demonstrating how ordered spatial sampling causes aliasing while random spatial sampling is anti-aliasing.


BiophysicalPhotoreceptorModel: This folder contains Matlab scripts for a biophysically realistic stochastically operating Drosophila R1-R6 photoreceptor model.


CalibrateLightInput-PhotoreceptorMovement: Folders contains the Matlab code for calculating light input to the photoreceptor models, which include the photoreceptor movement modulation caused by its photomechanically contracting rhabdomere.


PanoramicIntencitySeries: this folder contains a Matlab script for generating light intensity series time series from moving panoramic natural images.


SimulateMovementofRhabdomere: This folder contains a Matlab script for simulating photomechanical rhabdomere movements.


SNRAnalysis: this folder contains a Matlab script calculating signal-to-noise ratio of neural responses to repeated stimulation.  


VolterraModelOfPhotoreceptor: this folder contains a Volterra model to simulate photoreceptor responses.
